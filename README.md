Blazing-_fast_ zoomable map for Noita

> TLDR: This repo contains sources for a very high-resolution highly-performant map for the video game called [Noita](https://store.steampowered.com/app/881100/Noita/). Noitamap uses [OpenSeadragon](https://github.com/openseadragon/openseadragon).
This repo is basically a fork of whalehub's repo, which has been deleted from github but we had a [lucky fork](https://github.com/quiddity-wp/noita-map-viewer) with updated version of openseadragon and probably a different algo for creating the "pyramid" (zoomable) tiles.

The [map iself](https://map.runfast.stream) is being served by cloudflare pages with deployment from this repository.

We're using seed `786433191` while running map capture because it has a couple structures and secrets visible. If you find a seed with even more stuff, please open an issue!
