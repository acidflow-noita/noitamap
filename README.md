_Ultrafast_ Superzoom Map for Noita

![Map demo](https://github.com/acidflow-noita/noitamap/assets/106106310/94e0fb7e-4e0f-4419-9c14-38cace15efee)

> TLDR: This repo contains sources for a very high-resolution highly-performant map for the video game called [Noita](https://store.steampowered.com/app/881100/Noita/). Noitamap uses [OpenSeadragon](https://github.com/openseadragon/openseadragon).
> This repo started as a fork of whalehub's repo, which has been deleted from github but we had a [lucky fork](https://github.com/quiddity-wp/noita-map-viewer) with updated version of openseadragon and probably a different algo for creating the "pyramid" (zoomable) tiles. My goal is to create the best map viewing experience.

The [map iself](https://noitamap.com) is being served by cloudflare pages with deployment from this repository.

## Where can I find the source tiles?

All the current map captures are backed up as separate `7z` archives and can be found in a shared [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10oSm9NOv0mdWT98tWDB-97nuP_gp1qQz).

We're using seed `786433191` while running map capture because it has a couple structures and secrets visible. If you find a seed with even more stuff, please open an issue!

## I want to help, what can I do?

If you're a **developer**, contributions and discussions are welcome, feel free to open PRs and issues, take a look at the [project](<[url](https://github.com/orgs/acidflow-noita/projects/1)>) to see what work is being done.

If you're a **player**, you can help by capturing a new version of one of the game modes, or mods (maps with significant changes over time have date indication on the website), then stitch the map and upload an archive with what you've got to a sharing service like google drive, pixeldrain, gofile, etc, then opening an issue.

### How to capture a map

Download the latest release from the [noita-mapcap](https://github.com/Dadido3/noita-mapcap/releases/latest), unpack it and move the `noita-mapcap` directory into your noita mods folder.
To navigate to your mods folder either open the mods directory from inside the game by pressing `Mods`-->`Open mod folder`, or opening this directory:

```powershell
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Noita\mods\
```

Before starting the map capture process, check that all the mod settings are correct: use `3 Worlds` capturing mode with `60 frames` capture delay and seed set to `786433191`, all the settings should look exactly like on this screenshot excep for specific non-standard map sizes mods like alternative biomes.

### How to stitch a map

1. Navigate to the `Stitcher` directory, its location is:

```powershell
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Noita\mods\noita-mapcap\bin\stitch
```

2. Right click inside this directory and select "`Open in Terminal`"
   ![Launching Terminal](https://github.com/acidflow-noita/noitamap/assets/106106310/a46f1d51-53bc-4b2c-b3a2-799388e0c558)

3. Copy the following command and paste it into the terminal (either `Ctrl+V` or `Mouse right click`), **Do not run the command yet**, you will need to rename the output files following the naming convention: `gamemode-branch-world-patchDate-seedNumber.dzi` (e.g. `regular-main-branch-left-pw-2024-04-08-78633191.dzi`)

```powershell
.\stitch.exe --output nightmare-main-branch-left-pw-2024-04-08-78633191.dzi --blend-tile-limit 1 --dzi-tile-size 512 --xmin -53760 --xmax -17408 --ymin -31744 --ymax 41984 --webp-level 9 && .\stitch.exe --output nightmare-main-branch-middle-2024-04-08-78633191.dzi --blend-tile-limit 1 --dzi-tile-size 512 --xmin -17920 --xmax 18432 --ymin -31744 --ymax 41984 --webp-level 9 && .\stitch.exe --output nightmare-main-branch-right-pw-2024-04-08-78633191.dzi --blend-tile-limit 1 --dzi-tile-size 512 --xmin 17920 --xmax 53760 --ymin -31744 --ymax 41984 --webp-level 9
```

4. This will launch the stitcher and after it finishes you will see next to the `stitch.exe` 3 new directories (`gamemode-branch-world-patchDate-seedNumber_files`), and 3 new files (`gamemode-branch-world-patchDate-seedNumber.dzi`).

### How to share the capture results to get them added to Noitamap

1. Make a new directory, for example, `upload`, then create a directory inside it, call it `gamemode-branch-world-patchDate` and move the stitching results to it.
2. Create a `.7z` archive with the maximum compression level (`9`). You can do it manually by right-clicking the direrctory, then choosing "`7-zip`-->`Add to Archive`" and selecting `7z` format and "`9 - Ultra`" compression level, or you can open Windows Terminal inside the `upload` directory and execute this command:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Directory | ForEach-Object { & "${env:ProgramFiles}\7-Zip\7z.exe" a -mx9 "$($_.FullName).7z" "$($_.FullName)\*" }
```

Upload the `7z` archive you got to your favorite file sharing service (Google Drive, Mega, PixelDrain, Gofile, etc.) 4. Open a new issue with the `new-map-capture` label, provide details about the map you've captured and post the link.
